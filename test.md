I used Mozilla web developer tools and Chrome developer tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.

Site was tested across multiple virtual mobile devices and browsers. I checked all supported devices in both Mozilla web developer tolls and Chrome developer tools.

All tests Passed for devices from 360px on Chrome developer tools and Mozilla web developer tolls.
